AUD.js and AUD.java (master's thesis work) by Trayus

AUD is a system for procedurally generating music based off of a mood. This mood is given by 2 floats: stress & energy (the Thayer model of music mood). AUD is capable of adapting its generated music on the fly, making it an excellent tool for games. Whenever a shift in mood happens in the game, the music can be adapted with a single function call to reflect that change. 

To integrate AUD into a javascript application, all you need to do is include the aud.js file. To integrate the java version into a java application, include all .java files (except AUD_tester.java) and create a new AUD object. After that, you'll be able to control the audio with the relatively simple API, which is documented at <a href="http://timotheyadam.com/AUD" />.
